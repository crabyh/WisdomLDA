## COMPLETED WORK
<!-- One to two paragraphs, summarize the work that you have completed so far. -->
By far 


## GOALS AND DELIVERABLES
<!-- Do you still believe you will be able to produce all your deliverables? If not, why? What about the "nice to haves"? In your checkpoint writeup we want a new list of goals that you plan to hit for the Parallelism competition.
What do you plan to show at the parallelism competition? Will it be a demo? Will it be a graph? -->


## ISSUES AND CONCERNS
<!-- Are there any remaining unknowns (things you simply don't know how to solve, or resource you don't know how to get) or is it just a matter of coding and doing the work? If you do not wish to put this information on a public web site you are welcome to email the staff directly. -->
